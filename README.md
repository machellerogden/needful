# Needful

> do the needful

Needful is a micro library for functional-style programming in Node v10+.

## Why not use ramda / lodash / underscore?

[Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) is amazing. [Lodash](http://lodash.com) is insanely useful. [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/) started a movement.

If you want to take a functional-style approach on the front-end, use one of
the above.

If you're working in Node (> LTS) then chances are that the above libraries all have more than you need. It's true you can pull together just the pieces you want but at some point, it's easier to just to require one tiny dependency that covers the 80% use case. Needful doesn't have everything you'll want, but has what you'll need for basic functional-style programming.

**Warning:** Node 10+ only.
