# Needful

> A tiny functional-style library for the 80% use case.

## Why not use ramda / lodash / underscore?

Ramda is amazing. Lodash is insanely useful. Underscore started a movement.

The above libraries all have more than you need. It's true you can pull together just the pieces you want but at some point, it's easier to just have one tiny dependency which you can pull in for the 80% use case. Needful doesn't have everything you'll want, but has what you'll need for basic functional-style programming.
