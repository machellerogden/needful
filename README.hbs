# Why use Needful?

## Small

Needful exports a single 11kb UMD which covers the 90% use-case for functional-style JavaScript programming. It has equivalents to all the most useful parts of lodash (such as keypath operations) without all the pieces you probably don't need.

## Simple

Don't get mired in incidental complexity. Why waste cycles deliberating over how to most efficiently include lodash in your build, or fussing over whether you should use lodash-fp or lodash-es. Just pull in Needful and keep working the essential problem.

## Smart

Needful is clojurist-friendly. `0` == `true`. Also, immutability is baked-in. And, what's more, it uses structural sharing to give your code the best space and time complexity available. (Courtesy of [mediary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mediary).)

# Why not use lodash / ramda / underscore?

No one's stopping you.

Do you want a feature that Needful is missing? **Use [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).** It's got you covered.

Need automatic currying? **Use [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/).** It's got your back.

Want something time-tested and battle-hardened? **Use [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/).** It's been around foreverâ€”and it works.

Needful is smaller (11kb) and simpler (a single export) than its peers while still covering practically everything you'll need for effective functional-style JavaScript programming (over 5 dozen functions!).

Needful does the needful, and no more.
