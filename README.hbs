# Needful

Needful is a functionally-flavored micro library written in ECMAScript 2018.

# A few reasons to use Needful:
* single 3kb export covering the 80% use case
* immutability by default
* `0` == `true`

# Why not use lodash / ramda / underscore?

> You can't always get what you want
> But if you try sometimes you just might find
> You get what you need

Want a feature that Needful is missing? Use [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). It's got you covered.

Want automatic currying? Use [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/). It's got your back.

Want something time-tested and battle-hardened? Use [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/). It's been around foreverâ€”and it works.

Needful is smaller (3kb) and simpler (a single export) than its peers while still covering practically everything you'll need for effective functional-style JavaScript programming (over 5 dozen functions!).

Needful does the needful, and no more.
