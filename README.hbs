# A few reasons to use Needful:

* One tiny little UMD that covers the 90% use-case for functional-style JavaScript programming.
* All of the same `Array.prototype` methods you already know, but as immutable functions.
* Some of the most useful parts of lodash (such as keypath operations) without all the pieces you probably don't need.
* You understand how useful it is when `0` == `true` (clojurist-friendly)
* Did we mention immutability (with structural sharing courtest of [mediary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mediary))?

# Why not use lodash / ramda / underscore?

Do you want a feature that Needful is missing? Use [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). It's got you covered.

Need automatic currying? Use [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/). It's got your back.

Want something time-tested and battle-hardened? Use [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/). It's been around foreverâ€”and it works.

Needful is smaller (~16kb) and simpler (a single export) than its peers while still covering practically everything you'll need for effective functional-style JavaScript programming (over 5 dozen functions!).

Needful does the needful, and no more.
